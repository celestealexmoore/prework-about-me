      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Pastry Chef at Rice University and Instructor at San Jacinto College. While I enjoy my career in pastry, I've recently decided to delve into a new career! I'm now enrolled in the Coding bootcamp at Rice University, and I'll hopefully land a job as a software engineer before the end of the year.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The one and only H-town, Baybay!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>As you've probably guessed, baking and eating.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A wise prophetess once said, "I do not <em>dream</em> of labor." HA!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Oop that is a little too personal, Mr. Git.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>You want honesty? It's a reliable get-rich-quick scheme. But as I'm learning the ropes, I'm enjoying it more and more! I think I'll especially be into web design, front-end development for the cosmetic aspect. I feel like I'm pretty artsy and my developed eye from my pastry career could translate well.</p>
